# terraform-sandbox
The objective of this repository is to store various AWS scenarios implemented in Terraform. It's a dedicated space for experimenting with different configurations, testing new functionalities, and analyzing security features. Each folder represents a specific scenario that I use to safely explore and validate ideas.
